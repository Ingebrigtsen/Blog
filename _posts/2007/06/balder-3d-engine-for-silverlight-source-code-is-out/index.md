I've finally published the source code on CodePlex for the 3D engine posted earlier.  
It has been built with Visual Studio "Orcas" Beta 1.

The state of the source code is not 100% yet, but people can download it for now and have a look at how you could do a simple 3D engine. In addition a lot of featuers have not been made yet. During the next couple of weeks there will be additions to it.

For the time being I've invited a few friends to join in on the development, after some development time we will invite others to join as well. The project can be found at :

Feel free to come with any suggestions.
