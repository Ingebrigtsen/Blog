I figured the design for my blog was obsolete at best the other day and figured I should "steal" a new one and apply it.

Thanks to the brilliant [http://www.freewebtemplates.com/](http://www.freewebtemplates.com/ "http://www.freewebtemplates.com/") site I found a "web 2.0" styled template that was nice on the eyes (at least mine). :)Â 

Now I'll have to increase my posting activity to be just to the design!
