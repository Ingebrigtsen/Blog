A colleague of mine; Christian Schiffer has put up a new site with the focus on LINQ called missinglinq.no. The purpose of the site is to blog about LINQ and show examples of how to do things with LINQ.

Have a look : [http://www.missinglinq.no](http://www.missinglinq.no)

In addition to Christian doing some blogging, he will aggregate blogs such as mine and filter out only LINQ related articles based upon the tags.

Note : Articles will be in both Norwegian and English.
