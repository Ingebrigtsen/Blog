Where did time go??

It's been close to 2 years since my last post..   What happened?    I'll tell you what happened..   5th of March 2005 I became a dad to a beautiful little girl called Mia. We're now expecting another baby in May, so I have to hurry up with blogging till then, seeing that I tend to be totally thrown off for a couple of years when having a baby.. :)
