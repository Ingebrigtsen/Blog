I've come to a point in my life were I think I've figured out what I'm going to be when I grow up; **a developer.**  
Recently I've been jumping between jobs and found myself wanting to downgrade from being a Chieft of something something to being more of a hardcore developer.

I walked away from a position at a place called Notus a couple of months ago as the Manager of Application Development. I quit this job in june and started working for a startup company called Fjord Media. Being a startup company things weren't that organized that I've grown fond of, and found myself getting very stressed from the lack of structure and processes. I decided to quit and did so and walked out the building the same day without having a job to go to. During that day I started what I normally do when I'm looking for work; send out emails to friends and past colleagues to see if there would be any leads out there. Sure enough, the market is great these days so a couple of leads came my way the same day. I spent the next couple of days walking in and out of interviews and talking to people on the phone and writing emails. During this time I also found the time to start spinning thoughts around in my head about what kind of job would make be a happier person.

6 days after I quit my job at Fjord Media I had a meeting with my former employer, they contacted me the same day I quit and wanted to hear if I was interested in coming back. Not to the same position I held but a developer or team lead for one of the teams. After having the meeting with them I had this good vibe inside me; I was going to write code on a regular basis again. I got an offer later that day that was a very good offer;  I got to be a team lead/lead developer for the platform and architecture team. I was walking around the city when they called me with the offer, so I told them I had to call them back some 15-20 minutes later. It was then it really hit me with a good warm feeling inside of me; I am a developer, I will always be a developer, this is the profession I chose for myself ages ago. I couldn't wait to get home and pick up the phone and accept the offer. It couldn't get any better than this; I got to write code at a place where I knew (and love!) all the people, I knew the code (heck, I've worked there for 5.5 years..) and I got to do pretty cool stuff; work with the latest of .net related technologies (.net 3.0 and later 3.5, BT2006, SQL2005, VS2008, Silverlight..) .

The conclusion is **I am a developer and I'm proud of it!**

Now, on to writing some cool code..    I've got a couple of Silverlight thingies up my sleeve. :)
