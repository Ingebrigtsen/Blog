I've been drewling the last weeks over a brilliant motherboard from Axiomtek. It's form factor is Mini-ITX and is built around the Socket 479 for the CPU. It supports running a Intel Core 2 Duo processor for Socket M (479) with a FSB of 667 MHz.

For HTPC  machines it is brilliant not to mention for home servers that you just want to stove away somewhere and don't want to worry about space.. 

Anywayz.. Have a look at this beauty :

Make your local retailer import it! :)    I've encouraged everyone I talk to, to send my favourite retailer an email to make them import it..
