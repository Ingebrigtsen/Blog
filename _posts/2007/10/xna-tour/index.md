It seems I'm going on what turns out to look more and more like a tour with Microsoft's XNA as the focus. I will be speaking at NNUG (Norwegian Net User Group) in Bergen Wednesday the 31st of October 2007.  [http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Bergen/Moter/Brukergruppemote-oktober2/](http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Bergen/Moter/Brukergruppemote-oktober2/ "http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Bergen/Moter/Brukergruppemote-oktober2/")

In addition to this we're launching Game Camp Norway ([http://www.gamecamp.no](http://www.gamecamp.no)) on the 23rd of November 2007 at NITH in Oslo. We're still working on putting up the registration site and everything, but it's all going to be great fun.

On top of these events NNUG Oslo asked me to a session in springtime of 2008, details of this has yet to be laid out..  

I'm so excited. Finally I get to talk about game making utilizing the .net framework.

If you happen to be in the neighborhood for any the above mentioned events, drop by and have a look.
