We're closing in on the official kick off for Game Camp. 23rd of November is the date. The kick off will be in Oslo at NITH's facilities, we're getting speakers from Microsoft, Cap Gemini and myself to come and talk about different aspects of XNA and development of games using a managed environment such as .net. In addition we're working on getting Norway's biggest game developer, FunCom, to come and show off their latest title 'Age of Conan'. Fingers are being crossed for this to happen.

Anyhow, if you want to attend, and I know you want to, you have to go and register yourself for the event over at our Game Camp site :
