During the pregnancy we've been presented with a lot of different dates, ranging from late april till late may. Finally today we got the extension to the family we've been waiting for. His name is Herman and weighed in at a remarkable 4395 grams and had a length of 51 cm. Based upon the last dates presented by the doctor, he arrived exactly one week too late. His mother struggled for some 8 hours to bring him into this world and did a remarkable job (even though I was thrown one or two interesting sentences.:) )

Life is beatiful!

Based upon previous experience with getting kids, it will now take me two years or so before I write my next blog..   NOT...  :)    I'm too excited about Silverlight these days to not end up writing a post now and then..
