It's been a loooooong week.. I don't think I've ever experienced a longer week than last week. The reason; I installed RTM of VS2008 and didn't bother to check if the silverlight tools would work or that Microsoft had an update..Â 

"Finally" the update for the RTM/Release of VS2008 is out and ready to be downloaded :
