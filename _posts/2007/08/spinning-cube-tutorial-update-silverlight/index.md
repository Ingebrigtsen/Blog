I've upgraded the tutorial project to support Silverlight 1.1 Alpha Refresh for the spinning cube tutorial I wrote a couple of weeks ago ([http://www.dolittle.com/blogs/einar/archive/2007/07/19/spinning-cube-in-silverlight-alpha-1-1-using-c.aspx](/blogs/einar/archive/2007/07/19/spinning-cube-in-silverlight-alpha-1-1-using-c.aspx)).

Download the attached Zip file for the new version.
