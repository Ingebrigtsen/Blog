Last week I went out to rent a movie as I often do.  
Went home got my coke and put the movie in my DVD player.

As usual, in most Norwegian movies at least, it starts with a commercial. I'm not talking about previews, but commercials for potatochips and such. To my surprise though; they've turned off the ability to skip to the next chapter or get to the DVD menu, my SONY DVD player kept on saying "Operation prohibited by disc" which is the message it displays when the DVD has been programmed not to support a functionality.

I almost choked in anger..  Is it possible?  Here I go using my hard earned cash on renting a movie and then it turns out I've actually paid for commercials. A stunt like that makes piracy all of a sudden quite OK. I don't download movies, TV series or what not. If the industry wants people to stop copying their products, this is not the way to go about doing so. I'm pretty sure there are more people out there that get's angry about the principal of having to pay for commercials.

It would be quite OK having the commercials there and not being able to skip them if they were handing out DVDs. But when money has been changing owner it is not OK by a long shot.

Another thing they keep putting on the DVDs you buy and rent are the anti-piracy infomercials. Ehh.. I bought the thing.. I don't need to get reminded to not download the movie I just bought or rented.. HELLO..
