title: "Structure and work processes - do they bite?"

Today I reached a mutual agreement with my employer that it would be probably better if I didn't work there no more, so I handed in my resignation. No dramatics at all.

The company is a startup company and has been around for about 2 years now. The reason for me quitting the job was the fact that I wanted to add structure and process to the way they work and they didn't. I then felt that without the structure and a development process I would not be in a satisfactory working environment. Anywho.. 

I've been involved with a couple of startup companies in my time in the industry and find my self asking; why does it always hurt so much to to things in a more structured manner. The companies I've been involved with always claim the same thing; in our market we have to move from a day to day basis, otherwise we might as well just stop doing what we do. Why is it so scary to define a way of working that will ease the stress level and probably give the customer better quality?

Although the relationship with my last employeer ended on very good terms, I can't help to be a bit frustrated about the fact that one would not consider looking into the possibility to work in a better way with less stress. But hey.. Who am I to judge. Afterall, I came in there on the highest horse I could find and told them to do it like this and this and not like that...   Well.
