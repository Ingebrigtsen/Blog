Finally we got the time to organize another .net usergroup meeting here in Vestfold, Norway.  
  
This time around we've been lucky to get Tollef Slaathaug from [Baze Technology](http://www.bazetechnology.com/) to come and talk about their experience with creating a realtime dataengine for handling vast amount of data in .net.  
  
If you happen to be in Sandefjord this day and want to learn more, don't hesitate to sign up [here](http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Vestfold/Moter/Brukergruppemote-onsdag-29-april-2009/).
