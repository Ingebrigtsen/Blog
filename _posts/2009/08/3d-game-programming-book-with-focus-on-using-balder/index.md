Over the last 6-7 months we've been hard at work getting the Balder project up to speed, one of the motivational factors for working on the project has been a book project by [Gastón C. Hillar](http://www.packtpub.com/author_view_profile/id/280 "Gastón C. Hillar"). He started a journey on writing a 3D games development book for Silverlight and researched a few engines out there and landed on Balder to be the one for the book. His book is now being announced by [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) and will be coming out in both a paper version and an ebook version. We owe a lot of thanks to Gastón for trying out Balder at the different stages and coming with feedback during the development that has proven truely valuable. You can read more about the announcement [here](http://www.packtpub.com/3d-game-development-with-microsoft-silverlight-3-beginners-guide/book).
