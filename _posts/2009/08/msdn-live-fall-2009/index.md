Microsoft Norway has a tradition for hosting 2 MSDN Live events every year, one in the spring timeframe and one in the fall. This year they're having it in Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and Oslo.

The tour is kicked off in Stavanger on the 16th of September and is then moved on to Bergen on the 22nd and then Trondheim on the 24th, then concluding in Oslo on the 29th. This time around I will be part of the tour, which I'm really looking forward to.

**Content**  
Later this year Microsoft will be releasing a whole bunch of new technologies and products, and MSDN Live this time around will focus on these new technologies and how you can take advantage of them and what they will mean for you as a developer. The sessions will be on .net 4 + C#4, ASP.net 4, WPF 4 and Silverlight 3 (released earlier this year).

**Speakers  
**[BÃ¸rge Hansen](http://borge3000.no/), also part of the last tour and did a great job then, he will not disappoint anyone this time around either. He will kick off everything with an introduction to Visual Studio 2010, .net 4 and C# 4.

[Fredrik Kalseth](http://www.iridescence.no/), an ex-colleague of mine will focus on ASP.net 4. He is truely the one to show you new stuff in ASP.net 4, great developer and speaker!

Myself; I will be doing a talk about WPF 4 and Silverlight 3.

This tour will not have any Microsoft speakers, all independent content, custom created for the tour.

**What are you waiting for?
