We're starting to get a little bit of publicity with regards to the Balder project, which of course can hardly ever be a bad thing. :)

Gastón Hillar has just published an article on the [Dr.Dobbs](/admin/Pages/www.ddj.com) blog about Balder and the optimizations we've been working on the past couple of months. I think it is pretty much thanks to Gastón that Balder was revitalized earlier this year, and he has been very active with testing all the new bits we've been putting in and given us pin-pointers to were to start looking for optimizations and so on. A huge thanks to him for the article and the go-go-spirit in using Balder and giving us the kick in the behind we needed to get the engine to a more decent level.

You can find the article [here](http://www.ddj.com/go-parallel/blog/archives/2009/08/balder_a_silver.html).

Gastón has written a few books earlier that can be found over at [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/).
