2nd of July 2009, [Jonas Follesø](http://jonas.follesoe.no) got awarded the Silverlight MVP, congratulations to him. That is the second Silverlight MVP in Norway, we must be doing something right in this small country. :)

The second Silverlight MVP in Norway is actually me.  I've forgotten to announce it myself, but I was transferred to from being a Xna/DirectX MVP to become a Silverlight MVP a couple of months ago.

Again, congratulations to Jonas, well deserved!
