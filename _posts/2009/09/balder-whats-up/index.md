Some of you might have noticed that little to nothing has been done with Balder the last 30 days. Just want to check in and give you a heads up as to why. The reason is very simple, we've been really busy. We're two developers at the moment and both of us has had a handful at work, combined with running around doing different talks as well.Â 

September will pretty much be the same, so we're scheduled to resume Balder work at the end of September 2009. Our goal is to have a version 1 out within the end of the year.
