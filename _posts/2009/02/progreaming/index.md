I guess everyone do a little daydreaming now and then, about anything they care about. For instance, sitting in a boring meeting and your mind starts to wander and you're thinking about your family, your friends, something fun you will do after work and what not. For us developers I think these daydreams have a tendency to lean towards programming tasks. Whenever I have a moment were I am not doing something useful, my mind wanders away and starts writing some really cool code for something. The code being written could be a project I am working on and I'm actually solving tasks that need to be solved, other cases the code being written is all glamorous and in some cases not theoretically possible to write.

Â A little more than a week ago I was in Turkey and on several times found myself at a coffee place with some Turkish guys, on occasion they talked all Turkish, which is natural and my mind started to wander and programming something cool. The last day of my stay, I ended up in such a situation and sat there programming again until my mind started to wander even further and think about the concept of doing this disconnected programming. I needed a name for it, the idea of "Progreaming" was born, so from this point on I will refer to the concept as Progreaming.
