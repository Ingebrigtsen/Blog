From the 8th of February till the 13th of February I held a workshop in Turkey called "Workshop on Animation Simulation and Design" (WASD). The workshop was focused on game development using Microsoft Xna as the preferred platform.  
  
The first two days was dedicated to labs to get to know Xna from the bottom and up and aimed at developers with knowledge of C# and using Visual Studio 2008. 
  
I've made all the labs available as DOCX files to download from the links below:
