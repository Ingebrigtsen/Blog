Infrastructure for doing my podcasting was something I didn't think of before I started casting.  
  
Anyhow, my Podcast is now available through iTunes at the following [here](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=304523653).  
Â   
  
Within a day or two it should get indexed and be searchable within the iTunes store as well.
