Developers worldwide know Scott Hanselman and his podcasts. As one of the true community heroes of the web he has posted more than 150 podcasts covering a vast array of topics. Displaying developer skills he combines relevant stuff with humor when interviewing his subjects, making his podcasts enjoyable, useful and fun to listen to. I’ve been lucky enough to catch the busy Scott for an interview. Tune in and see how it went.  
  
It was originally recorded as a WebCast, so you'll find both the video and audio only here.
