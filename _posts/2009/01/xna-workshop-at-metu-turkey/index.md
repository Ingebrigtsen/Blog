On the 9th of February till the 13th of February, I will be holding a workshop at [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/) for Microsoft Turkey. The workshop will focus on game programming with the use of Xna 3.0. 
  
The workshop will be similar to the [workshop I held last year](/post/2008/04/23/XNA-Workshop-at-METU-in-Ankara-Turkey.aspx), but with more focus on Xbox 360 development and more indepth.  
  
After the workshop I will be posting the content and hopefully we'll get it all on video and post that as well. Can't wait to get down there and hold the workshop, it was really great doing it last year.
