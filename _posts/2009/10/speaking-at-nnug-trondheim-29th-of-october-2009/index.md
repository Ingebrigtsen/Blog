I will be speaking at NNUG Trondheim next week about how one can go about creating games using managed code with focus on Xna and Silverlight. The user group meeting is a cooperation with Javabin. 

If you happen to be in Trondheim on the 29th of October, stop by for a great evening with Anders Nordås talk about patterns and myself for the gaming section.

You can sign up and read more over at [NNUG](http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Trondheim/Moter/NNUG-Trondheim---29-oktober-2009/).
