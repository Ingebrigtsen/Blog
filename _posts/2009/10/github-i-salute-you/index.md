I've been using CodePlex with both the TFS integration and SVN for quite a while and recently started using GitHub, especially for the [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) project, and must say that I'm very impressed with what they have over at GitHub. Not only is Git something I'm really falling in love with and the way GitHub handles this, but simple things as the Issue tracking is so nice. GitHub is ultrafast, anything one does, its instant. Adding and modifiying issues is like working locally, kudos for this. 

One of the things I discovered the other day was the ability to host your pages there as well. Plain HTML hosting, something I've been missing at CodePlex, the best part, the HTML being hosted is versioned by Git - of course.
