On monday (30th of November 2009) we had a new release of Balder, version 0.8.8.0. Since then I've been busy getting tutorials up on the site for not only the new stuff but also covering usage in general. All the tutorials are available [here](http://balder.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Tutorials&referringTitle=Home).  

Also, for the release I decided it was time to get a logo for the project, so opened my favourite 3D modelling software and photo/image editor and had a go, and ended up with the following.
