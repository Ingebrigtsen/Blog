On the 9th of February, Software 2010 is kicked off. [Petri Wilhelmsen](http://digierr.spaces.live.com/) and myself will be holding an hour on game development with managed code using Microsoft Xna and Silverlight (featuring Balder). We will be focusing on 3D development and cross-platform using .net.

Really looking forward to doing a co-op with Petri.
