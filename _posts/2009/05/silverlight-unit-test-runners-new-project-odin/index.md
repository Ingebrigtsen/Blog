I've been busy the last couple of nights doing a complete rewrite of my original SilverlightRunners project.  
The reason for this was that the structure of the original project didn't agree with me, hard to write unit tests, bad structure - had the feeling of being rushed. Also, having the implementational details it had, stability was really bad. Another point was that I wanted to rebrand the project.  
  
The new project has been called Odin (yes, I know - what is going on with all this Norse Mythology fetish I seem to have..) and is located on [Codeplex.](http://odin.codeplex.com/)  
  
For the time being there is a 0.4 release, with an MSI file for easier installation. The current version only has limited support for running the unit tests through commandline.Â  I am working hard these days to complete the 0.5 release to have a feature full execution engine for running tests and full commandline support. Then I'll be moving on to recreating the resharper support, targetting R# 4.5.
