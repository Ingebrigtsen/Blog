We're closing in a version 1.0 release of Balder, for the moment we're at Alpha and we decided to put out a release on the Balder codeplex site for everyone to start working with.

The release can be found [here](http://balder.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx#ReleaseFiles). In addition we've started on a getting started guide as well to get you up and running pretty quick, it is located [here](http://balder.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=GettingStarted&referringTitle=Home).
