The license for [Bifrost](http://github.com/dolittle/bifrost) used to be shared between [Dolittle](http://www.dolittle.com) and [Komplett](http://komplett.com/en/home/)  as a joint venture that began a couple of years ago. As our focus an investment is moving more and more into Bifrost, we have agreed with Komplett that Dolittle is taking ownership of the license and the project. With this we also want to simiplify the licensing, so we're moving to a standard [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) without any special clause like we used to have - plain vanilla.

So, what does this mean if you're using Bifrost?

Well, nothing actually, it means that its a simpler model - there is one party that holds the copyright, no special clauses, a well known and well used license.
