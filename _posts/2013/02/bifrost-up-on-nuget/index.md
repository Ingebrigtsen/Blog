We are super excited, we finally managed to get [Bifrost](http://bifrost.dolittle.com) up on [Nuget](http://nuget.org/packages?q=Bifrost). We will be publishing packages as soon as we have changes, new features and such. We'll get back to you on how we're going to deal with versioning and what our strategies are for continuously deploying to Nuget will be.Â 

With our push to Nuget we added a [QuickStart](http://nuget.org/packages/Bifrost.QuickStart/) package that one can use to get up and running quickly, all you need to do after adding the package is to compile and run and you'll have a simple sample that shows how Bifrost is setup and how you can get started writing your features.
