The 25th of April we're continuing the success by holding yet another Game Camp event.  
NITH has been kind enough to let us use their facilities, once again.

This time around we're having two excellent sessions:

[Digiment](http://www.digiment.no) will come and talk about how to start your own business within games development and how to survive in the business.

After this, Petri Wilhelmsen will talk about how to do XNA Shaders Programming - the gold that gives modern games the realistic look.

To attend you need to register [here](http://gamecamp.no/Events/default.aspx).
