I was asked earlier by Microsoft if I could hold a workshop in Turkey.

On the 20th of May I'll be heading down to Ankara and hold a 3-4 day workshop for a competition Microsoft is holding at the [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr). I'm working on the agenda as we speak and thus far it's starting to look very interesting. My goal is to have a more or less complete walkthrough of XNA. Ambitious you might say. That's my plan at the moment at least. :)
