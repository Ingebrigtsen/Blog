title: "6 weeks paternity leave"

Norway has a great paternity leave option for us fathers. The mothers still get most of the total parental leave that is made available, but 6 weeks time off to spend with your kid is great.

I for one am looking forward to this time, not only because it is time off, but I get to spend some quality time with my son that I otherwise don't have the luxury of doing.

Starting from this monday (14th of April 2008), I'll be chilling out at home with my son; Herman.

I guess I'll be doing this blog though.. :) (and probably some code every so often..)
