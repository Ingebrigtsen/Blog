On the 27th of November, IKT Grenland in Porsgrunn Norway is hosting their developer forum. They've invited me to hold a talk about Silverlight 2 and why one should use this technology.  
  
If you're Porsgrunn and want to catch "the wind" of Silverlight, don't hesitate to register for the event [here](http://www.iktgrenland.no/Utviklerforum/Kalender/27.-november-2008-19-45-00-Soekemotor-Silverlight-2.0).
