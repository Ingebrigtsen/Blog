Finally the news of Xna 3.0 struck me as well. Its been some days since the release of Xna 3.0, but with a hectic schedule I am not always fitting in time to read my RSS feeds. Anywho, he Xna team delivers, again. Finally, the release of version 3.0 of Xna is out. A lot of new features is included in this release. To mention a few:  
  
\* Visual Studio Integration : Support for C# 3.0, LINQ  
\* Try before you buy: You can allow your customers to try your game before they buy it  
\* Invitations: You can programatically allow players to invite friends to join their game  
\* In addition Windows and Xbox 360, there is now Zune support (when will Europe get this?)  
\* OneClick deployment of Windows Games
