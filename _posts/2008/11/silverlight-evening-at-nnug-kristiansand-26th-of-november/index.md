I will be holding an all Silverlight evening at NNUG Kristiansands next user group meeting.  
  
The meeting will be in two sections; basics of Silverlight and using expression blend together with Visual Studio to create your solutions. The second part will dwell into more advanced features and how it all fits in your enterprise development.  
  
If you happen to be in the neighbourhood and feel like getting some Silverlight goodness, don't hesitate to sign up [here](http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Kristiansand/Moter2/NNUG-Kristiansand---November-2008/).
