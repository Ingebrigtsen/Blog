Finally, the beta release we've all been waiting for (at least me and a couple of other guys out there.. :) ) .

The runtime can be found [here](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/resources/installationFiles.aspx?v=2.0)

Microsoft Silverlight tools beta 1 for Visual Studio 2008 can be found [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E0BAE58E-9C0B-4090-A1DB-F134D9F095FD&displaylang=en).

and finally the Silverlight 2 SDK Beta 1 can be found [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=4E03409A-77F3-413F-B108-1243C243C4FE&displaylang=en).

:)

And now, I need to download from the same URLs myself and get started. I will most likely return to this blog with some thoughts, at least I think so..

Happy hunting everyone..
