I've been quite busy with moving from our old house to the new one and have just recently (the last couple of days), gotten all my computer equipment gathered in one place and all the furniture needed to be able to sit down and hack away at the keyboard.

This means that I can finally return to the blogosphere and get something out there. :)  

Today I've added the [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/) kick it link to the blog and all its posts. Feel free to start kicking any of the posts, if you find it interesting ofcourse. :)
