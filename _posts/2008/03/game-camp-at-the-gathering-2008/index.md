Another event just appeared out of the blue.  
We got approached by Microsoft yesterday and was asked if we had the resources and capacity to hold a workshop of some sort at [The Gathering 2008](http://www.gathering.org/tg08/).

**Good news:** Game Camp is showing up and will hold a full day at [the Gathering 2008](http://www.gathering.org/tg08/) with the focus on learning XNA. We'll get back to you within a day or two with more specifics. Keep watching the [Game Camp news feed](http://www.gamecamp.no) for updates. :)
