We're holding our 9th user group meeting on the 27th of March 2008. The entire evening will focus on MVC (Model View Controller) in ASP.net and on the Windows Mobile Platform.

Christian Schiffer will hold the ASP.net talk and Raymond Holmboe will hold the Windows Mobile talk.

Are you in the neighborhood and feel like getting the details on MVC, register [here](http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Vestfold/Moter/Brukergruppemote-torsdag-27-mars-2008/).
