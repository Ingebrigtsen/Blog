title: "Balder 3D engine ready for Silverlight RC0"

It was relatively painless getting the Balder 3D engine up and running on the RC0 of Silverlight.  
The project on Codeplex is now up and running with the latest modifications.  
  
In addition we've been working on a refactoring with texturemapping especially in mind. We also want it all to be nice and declaratively done in Xaml. You'll find a refresh sample [here](http://localhost:8080/silverlight/BalderCubeWithTextures/TestPage.html).
