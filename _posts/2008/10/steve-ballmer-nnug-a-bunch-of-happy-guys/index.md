Two weeks ago, the day before I got awarded the MVP title - another big thing happened. The guys at NNUG (Norwegian .Net User Group), including myself had the chance to meet with Steve Ballmer and got our picture taken with him. How cool was that. I'll tell ya..  Reallllly cool..  Thanks to Rune Grothaug with the Norwegian DPE team at Microsoft for making this happen.
