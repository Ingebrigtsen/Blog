We're slowly getting all the video material from the Game Camp we held in September up on YouTube. The keynote from Scott Bilas is up now and can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22Game+Camp+September+2008%22&search_type=&aq=f).  
  
Over the next couple of days we will be publishing the rest of the material, alongside with the powerpoints and samples created on stage.
