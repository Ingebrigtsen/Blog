Finally, the day is almost here; PreConference PDC. Landed approximately at 3PM local Los Angeles time and picked up my rental and headed down to Huntington Beach, were I am staying at a friends house.  
  
Tomorrow there will be all kinda cool material at the PreConference, but my eye is on (not very surprising) the Silverlight part held by Jeff Prosise (read more [here](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/Preconference.aspx#creating-rich-internet-applications-with-silverlight)). Looking forward to this and 4 more days of endless coolnes. Hope to meet up with a lot of people.  
  
And now, on to consuming a couple of beers and enjoying life as a whole. :)
