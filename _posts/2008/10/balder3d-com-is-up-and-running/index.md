Thanks to Clinton Rocksmith on the Balder team, we're now up and running with a dedicated site for hosting all the details about the project; [http://www.balder3d.com](http://www.balder3d.com).Â  The site will be the place to look for tutorials, forum, downloads and more related to the project.  
  
Hope you'll find it interesting. Please feel free to come with suggestions to the site, tutorials you'd like to see or anything else.
