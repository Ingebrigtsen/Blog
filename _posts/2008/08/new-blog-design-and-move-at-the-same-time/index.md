Im relaunching myself with a brand new design at a brand new location.

This blog will continue over at the following URL:

For those of you who´ve been subscribing through the Feedburner [URL](http://feeds.feedburner.com/einari) will not notice any outtage, everything has been updated and redirected properly.

If you´re still subscribing to the old RSS link, please update to the Feedburner one above.

Hope you´ll enjoy the new design and keep on reading my ramblings. :)

Please leave me a comment if you have any. Also if you feel like your missing something, or you find the design to be ugly or non functional. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

**And now for some credits.**

I´ve done the design partially myself. Believe me when I say I´m no graphics artist or designer, so I have to get inspiration and "borrow" ideas from here and there. The top header is ofcourse my own, but the content part is a modified version of the [Gluttony Wordpress Theme](http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/11/25/gluttony-wordpress-theme/) that was adopted to BlogEngine by [GravityCube](http://www.gravitycube.net/blog/). In addition to this, I´ve gotten the contact actions icons and BlogEngine.net code for using them from [David Burke](http://www.dbvt.com/), thanks again for helping me out.
