In Norway, when you have a non-profit organization and you deal with money, such as sponsor funding or similar, you need to be registered with the authorities. The sponsor won´t be able to transfer any money to you unless you have an organization code provided by the authorities. We´ve been working to get Game Camp registered as this for a while now and finally today we got the message that out application has been [accepted](http://tinyurl.com/5bonqt).

Which is kind of perfect, seeing that we´re in the midst of finalizing everything for our [event on the 26th of september](http://www.gamecamp.no/events/default.aspx).
