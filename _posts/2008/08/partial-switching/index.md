The new position I´m starting at Objectware the 1st of September is focused around Silverlight and WPF. Seeing that Silverlight truely is cross platform, I asked for a MacBook Pro as the preferred computer and got one. The reason for this is both professionally, seeing that I will be working a lot with Silverlight, but also on the personal side. I wanted to explore a part of the universe I´ve never been and I wanted to do it properly. The plan is to use only Windows for Visual Studio and have everything else as software in Mac OSX.  

As a true Windows man, I was quite curious as to how this journey would end up. The weeks prior to getting the computer I read articles and started to get familiar with the user interface by skinning my Windows to look and "feel" like Mac OSX. Still, after doing all this preparation I can truely say that I was not prepared at all. Keep in mind that besides Windows, the only operating systems I´ve ever had has been C64, Atari TOS, Amiga OS, OS/2 and DOS.  

Thus far, the experience has been quite positive. Apple has truely created a complete experience. The only thing I´ve been having trouble with is to find free software for the things I need; newsreading, blogging, screencasting, torrents. It seems that it is more common for people to pay for software for the Mac. It´s not that the software is expensive, usually the price is some $20-$30. I guess I´m just spoiled for not being used to it. I´ve so far landed on the following software for the 4 activities mentioned:  

\* Newsreading = NewsGators [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx "NetNewsWire")  
\* Blogging = Brain Juices [Blogo](http://drinkbrainjuice.com/blogo "Blogo") (In fact, this article was written with it)  
\* Screencasting = Ambrosia Softwares [Snapz Pro](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/ "Snapz Pro")  
\* Torrents = [xTorrent](http://www.xtorrent.com/ "xTorrent")  

For virtualization, I´m using Parallels. I liked their Coherence mode better than VMWare Fusions. The Windows installation runs in Boot Camp and is used directly by parallels. Runs smoothly. Just gotta figure out the occassional bluescreen I´m having.

One of my goals the next 6 months is to get started with some development targetting the Mac using XCode and Objective C. Also I´ve been wanting to look into iPhone development. The SDK is downloaded at least, so let´s see what the future holds.
