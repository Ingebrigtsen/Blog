I’ve moved my RSS feed over to Feedburner. For those of you who are subscribing, I’ve done my best to add redirection to the HTTP response from Community Server so that you don’t need to update the URL (keeping my fingers crossed).

The new URL for my feed is : [http://feeds.feedburner.com/einari](http://feeds.feedburner.com/einari "http://feeds.feedburner.com/einari")
