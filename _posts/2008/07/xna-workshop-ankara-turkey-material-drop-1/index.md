The Xna workshop held in Ankara, Turkey is now over, I’ll post all the material during this week. This will be the first material drop of a few.

This drop contains the sample I worked on for the workshop, it is crude but it shows how easy things can be done in Xna.

You can download the material from [here](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/2012/07/XnaWorkshopMaterialDrop1_Turkey2008.zip).

The sample is entry-level Xna (level 100).  
All implementations are "crude" and should be used as a reference rather than  
production code.

The sample shows the following using Xna:

\* How to render 3D models  
\* How to get a mesh skinned with animation  
\* How to create a camera and move it in a 3D world  
\* How to use game components  
\* How to use game services  
\* How to use gamepads and keyboard for input

The 3D world is a famous site in Turkey called Cappadocia and the  
3D model was downloaded from METU, the university we held the workshop. It can be found [here](http://cgv.ceng.metu.edu.tr/virtual/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=3&Itemid=56).

The skinned mesh character along with the animation and components for using  
it was downloaded from the creators club website and is licensed under the  
[Microsoft Permissive License](http://creators.xna.com/downloads/?id=15). Skinned mesh sample can be found [here](http://creators.xna.com/en-us/sample/skinnedmodel).
