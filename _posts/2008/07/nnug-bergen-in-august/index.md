August is traditionally the startup month after the summer for [NNUG](http://www.nnug.no) activities and [NNUG Bergen](http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Bergen/) has really put together a killer evening as a startup for the fall.

On the 29th of August, they’re having the most impressive lineup in NNUGs history (as far as I know). [Dan North](http://dannorth.net/) from [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) and [Christian Weyer](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/) from [Thinktecture](http://www.thinktecture.com/) are coming.

Keep up the good work guys!!
