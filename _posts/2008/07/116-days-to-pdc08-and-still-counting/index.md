Still got funds left that can be spent for a developer related conference? You should really consider going to Microsoft's PDC this year. I’ve been to PDC’03 and PDC’05 and they were awesome, I would expect nothing less from the conference this year.

Anyways, go to [http://microsoftpdc.com/](http://microsoftpdc.com/ "http://microsoftpdc.com/") and get your ticket today. (Apparently I was the first Norwegian guy to get a ticket.. Ordered it the same day they got available..  :) )

Hope to see you there!
