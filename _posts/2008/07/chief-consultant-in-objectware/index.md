After some 6 and a half years working at the same job (Notus, acquired by [Visma](http://www.visma.no/index.asp) this year), Iâ€™ve just signed a contract with [Objectware](http://www.objectware.no/no/) a part of the [Itera Consulting Group](http://www.iteraconsulting.com/about+us). I will start there on the 1st of September this year.

Some of you might have noticed a comment on one of my latest posts; congratulating me on my new job, way before it was ready to be announced to the world. :) Well, the cat is out of the bag.
