During the workshop I held a few presentations were I walked through different concepts. The presentations was ranging from how to get started with a game project, independent from technology – to graphics concepts and finally specifically using Xna to do the job.

You’ll find all the presentations [here](http://localhost:8080/wp-content/2012/07/XnaWorkshopMaterialDrop2_Turkey2008PowerPoints.zip).
