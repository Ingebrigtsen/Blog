I held a talk yesterday (28th of february 2008) a talk about XNA. The talk is pretty much what I held at Game Camp last year which was a revised version of what I had at NNUG Bergen in October last year.

Anywho, if you're interested in the material you can download it from this posts attachment.

The solution is a city in which you move around in with your Xbox gamepad or keyboard (arrow keys to move, A for flying up, Z for flying down, U for looking up and D for looking down).
