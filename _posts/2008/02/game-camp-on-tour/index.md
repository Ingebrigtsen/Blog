This year Game Camp will be on tour and host several events.  
I was asked earlier to hold an XNA talk at NNUG (Norwegian .Net User Group) in Oslo and will have this on the 26th of february.

If you want to come and listen to a fast introduction to XNA and you happen to be in the neighbourhood, stop  
by the [event page and register](http://www.nnug.no/Avdelinger/Oslo/Moter/Brukergruppemote-februar-2008/).
