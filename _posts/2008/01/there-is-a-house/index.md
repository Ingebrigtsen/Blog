... in Sandefjord, Norway that's looking for a new owner. :)

After living in the same house for 6 years, we're now selling it and moving to the other side of town. Besides working heavily on my computer over the last years, the house has also gone from a early 1980s combined with early 1950s standard to 200x standard. I've done most of the work myself. Finally we finished it and then we're moving, sounds familiar ?? 

Anywho..  If you know anyone who wants a nice house here in Norway, our house might be the thing they're looking for.  :)

Have a look :
