Another cool thing with XNA 3.0 is the ability to use MP3 and WMA files directly. This gives better compression for your music than the average of 27% before. These files can also be added directly to your content folder and used from the ContentManager as you would with any other content.

[Kyle Schouviller](http://www.kyleschouviller.com) has made an example of how to use this, check it out [here](http://www.kyleschouviller.com/uncategorized/xna-30-mp3wmawav-support/).
