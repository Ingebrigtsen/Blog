JavaFX was announced this week at JavaOne. I first heard about it about a year ago and have been waiting ever since for what they are working on. It certainly looks like a direct competitor with Flash and Silverlight, but they're also aiming for more than just browser experience. They have 2 things going for it that is really great; 3D support out-of-the-box and tools support the Mac.

I guess I gotta sign up and have a go at this. After all, it's only fair after doing a lot of Silverlight stuff and attempting to do stuff with Flash earlier.
