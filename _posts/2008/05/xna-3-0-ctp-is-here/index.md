Finally the CTP we've all been waiting for is here. You can now pick it up [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=DF4AF56A-58A7-474C-BFD0-7CF8ED3036A3&displaylang=en) and start developing for Windows, Xbox 360 and Zune (if you're lucky enough to own one). Another great news with this is that it supports Visual Studio 2008. It's time to see if I can finally uninstall Visual Studio 2005.

Xbox 360 development and deployment is not supported by this CTP, unfortunately.

Anyhow.. More details can be found [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2008/05/07/announcing-xna-game-studio-3-0-community-technical-preview-ctp.aspx).
