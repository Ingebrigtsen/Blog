One of the things that has been really annoying in XNA 1.0 and 2.0 is the fact that you had to use XACT for everything that had to do with sound. A real painstaking process that really felt like we were back doing super nintendo development in DOS (Ok, probably a bit exaggerated). Anyhow, they've finally gone about making this process as brilliant as it should be.

Now you can simply drag'n'drop a wav file into the content folder and you can load it as content directly via the ContentManager.

You still have to use XACT if you want to more advanced audio stuff, but for the simple sound effects and such, this is brilliant. Read more about it [here](http://letskilldave.com/archive/2008/05/07/the-best-kept-secret-about-the-xna-game-studio-3-0-ctp.aspx).
