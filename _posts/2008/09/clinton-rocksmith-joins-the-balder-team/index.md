I'd like to officially welcome Clinton Rocksmith to the Balder team. He will start creating samples and tutorials for Balder and join in on the general programming as well. Clinton has been working with Silverlight for a while now and worked on a Silverlight project for the-hub.tv in New Zealand that you can find [here](http://the-hub.tv/silverlight/).  
  
So, pay attention to the Balder project over at [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/Balder), we've got quite a bit of content planned.
