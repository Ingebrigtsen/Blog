I am sitting on the bus right now on my way to my first day at Objectware. My official title is Technology Evangelist. The job will consist of consultant work, community work, blogging and other related activities. This should in theory mean that I get more time to post here and do talks at places like [NNUG](http://www.nnug.no).  
  
This is my first job were I am doing consultant work, I've always been working for ISVs. Hopefully I'll adapt fast. I must admit that this is a bit scary. :)  
  
Waiting to get started at a new job can make the days very long, imagine doing it when you're sitting at home the last 10 weeks. I am very very excited, can't wait to dive into some Silverlight work.  
  
Wish me luck...
