It’s 12 hours and some 20 minutes till Scott Hanselmann will enter the stage at NDC 2008. I’m all excited.. :)

Finally we get a proper event for developers in Norway, a chance for us developers to socialize more than we normally do. Great stuff. The lineup is incredible, great work from the guys behind the event (I know at least one guy; [Rune Grothaug](http://blogs.msdn.com/grothaug), has been working a lot to realize this).

Hope to see everyone there tomorrow. Have a safe flight everyone that is flying in.
