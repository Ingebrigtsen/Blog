I've been in Istanbul and Ankara in Turkey for this week, and unfortunately it is coming to an end.

Together with Microsoft Turkey, we've been holding a full Xna workshop and I must say it's been really great. All the students attending have shown their interest in the subject. They got an assignment; to create a game in 3 days. A heavy task to undertake, you might say. Thus far, the results have been astonishing. They really picked up Xna fast and had stuff up and running really fast. I'm looking forward to seeing the result tomorrow.

Ofcourse, all material will be released in several places. Also, Microsoft has recorded all presentations on video and will also be available soon.

All hands-on-labs will be published over at [Game Camp](http://www.gamecamp.no/)Â sometime next week.

I'll keep you all posted with the details as fast as I can.
