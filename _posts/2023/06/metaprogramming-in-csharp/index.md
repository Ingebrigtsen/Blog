Wondering what to do this summer vacation? ☀️

🚀Thrilled to announce that my latest book; "Metaprogramming in C#" is now available for pre-ordering.

It was a great journey writing this, had great fun doing so. And can't wait to hear feedback from you as a reader.

I wanted to create a book about how you take advantage of different aspects of .NET to become more productive,
remove tedious tasks and also deliver more maintainable and consistent code.
Metaprogramming has always been high on my own agenda and has helped me throughout my career.
This book is written based on personal experience.

You can preorder it at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-Automate-your-development-simplify-ebook/dp/B0C53T3SQS/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Metaprogramming+in+C%23&qid=1685613793&s=books&sr=1-2)

🤎 Thanks for all the support given by the team at Packt while writing this book and helping it come to life. Also want to thank [Marius Iulian Mihailescu]() for the technical review.

🤎🤎 A special thanks to my family for their patience as it took a lot of my spare-time to write this.
