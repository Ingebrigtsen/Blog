Yesterday, [Pavneet Singh Saund](http://pavsaund.wordpress.com/) and I held a talk for [NNUG Vestfold](http://www.nnug.no) about modern Web development using the MVVM pattern and compositional UIs.

The slides can be found [here](http://www.slideshare.net/einari/sugarcoating-your-frontend-one-viewmodel-at-a-time).

In addition we talked about a few things, these are the resources of the talk :

[KnockoutJS](http://www.knockoutjs.com)  
[Bifrost  
](http://www.github.com/dolittlestudios/bifrost)[Forseti](http://www.github.com/dolittlestudios/forseti)

I did mention and tried to demo another site I'm working on, which was down at the time - but up now :

[Geekrider](http://www.geekrider.com) - it shows navigation of features, using Bifrost.

and lastly, the actual demo app we did can be found [here](http://www.github.com/einari/toodeloo). We did also show the inkFinder that was developed at [Komplett](http://www.komplett.no) that uses Knockout and MVVM, which you can find [here](http://www.komplett.no/k/inkFinder.aspx).
