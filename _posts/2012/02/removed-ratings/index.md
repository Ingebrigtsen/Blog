title: "Removed ratings"

Recently I've had a couple of strange ratings on posts here. People, in plural, rating simple posts that basically just announce a talk to a 1 out of 5 and not leaving a comment. That just messes with my head. There is no way I can improve posts when there is just a bunch of negative rating but no comments. As a consequence, I decided to remove ratings all together - hopefully forcing people to engage in a conversation instead.

If there is something you don't like in a post, or the entirety of a post - please don't hesitate to post a comment. I'm very open to listening to feedback, but I can't just read into the lack of a star and figure out what I'm doing wrong.
