title: "Balder License - changes"
date: "2010-07-29"

A lot of effort has been put into the [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) project, and with the recent work on moving Balder onto multiple platforms and not only Silverlight. I've decided its time to change the license a bit.

For anyone using Balder today with Silverlight on the Web/Desktop, there are no changes - with the exception of one thing. If you're developing a commercial library or package that can be conceived as a competitor to Balder - then you need a commercial license. Other than that, no changes.

The intention of the license change is to start getting commercial opportunities from all the work being put in and to finance the further development of the project. From being something I did a few hours a week, its slowly becoming a project that could easily take my entire attention and then some. And developers need food on the table as well. :)

Anyways, the license I'm proposing is as follows. The price-model for the additional platforms that are being added, has not yet been decided. If you have any input on the license itself, please leave a comment, drop me an email or start a discussion on the [Codeplex site for Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com).
