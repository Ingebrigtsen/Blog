Its over a month ago I announced 0.8.8.9 of [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) coming along. That after having 2 week iterations on releases. Its the case of "just want to get that feature done", "just want to fix that bug", combined with a lot of other work, non-Balder related, thats causing a delay.

Meanwhile, the source is in constant move and a lot has happened since 0.8.8.8.

Hopefully, next week will see the release of the new version.
