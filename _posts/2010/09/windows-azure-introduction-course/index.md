This fall I've been asked by Microsoft to hold a free introduction course in Windows Azure. Its a subject I find very interesting and really looking forward to be talking about.

The date is 5th of October and will be held at Microsoft Norway in Oslo.

I'll also have deep dive courses later this fall and winter, but I'll have to get back with details on when that will happen.

Anyways, save the date and register online already today [here](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032461924&EventCategory=1&culture=nb-NO&CountryCode=NO).
