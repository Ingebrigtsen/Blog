One of the things that has been missing in the Silverlight development story is a proper profiler that is simple to use and does not require you to hack the registry or do complex command line hacks to get it working. The Danish company called [EQATEC](http://www.eqatec.com)Â has been making profilers for a while for the compact framework, but now they have implemented a Silverlight version that I must say I'm really impressed with. EQATEC has donated a professional license to the [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) project and I have already started using it, and my findings are very interesting. I've found more bottlenecks the last 24 hours than I have during the entire course of the project without a profiler. So I'm expecting [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) to get even more speedier in the near future.

If you want to have a look at how the profiler works, Channel 9 has a great video on it [here](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/martinesmann/First-code-profiler-for-Silverlight/).
