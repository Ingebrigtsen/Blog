For probably more than a year now, submitting an email to me on my blog hasn't worked. I've looked at the settings a bunch of times but without figuring out the problem. No error messages to be found anywhere. Well, turns out, there was a small typo in the email adress and it has been sending to an inbox that doesn't exist.So, if anyone has been trying to contact me through the contact page, I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you.
