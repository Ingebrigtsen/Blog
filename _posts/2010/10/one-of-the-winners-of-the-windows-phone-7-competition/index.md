Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a [competition](http://appkonkurranse.spaces.live.com/) for creating a Windows Phone 7 app. Yesterday it was announced that I was one of 3 lucky winners of the competition, the two other winners being [Sigurd Snorteland](http://sigurdsnorteland.wordpress.com/) and [Ronny Gydar](http://gydarindustries.com/). The grand prize; a Windows Phone 7 device.

The results were announced at the [Windows Phone Developer Community meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Windows-Phone-Developer-Community/) yesterday.

Thanks a lot to the jury for picking my app as one of the winners, and to the sponsor of the hardware for providing the phones - that will be in my mailbox soon, I've been told. Can't wait to get my hands on it.
