Things are moving fast these days with [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) and I am closing in on the next release already. Keeping up with my target pace.

At this point these are the things already done or is in progress for the next release:

- New Skybox, utilizing built in Silverlight perspective projection, which can be hardware accelerated  
    
- Perspective correct texture mapping - previous version had only affine texture mapping  
    
- Bilinear filtering for texture mapping  
    
- Performance boost for the entire rendering pipeline  
    
- Better, faster and more accurate lighting  
    
- Subpixel rendering  
    
- Vertex-shader like functionality for SIlverlight  
    
- Multiple "Games" in one page  
    
- Multiple textures during rendering  
    
- Semitransparent / alpha-channel support for texture mapping
- Introducing a control for no-game centric applications; Content3D  
    
- A lot of bugfixing
