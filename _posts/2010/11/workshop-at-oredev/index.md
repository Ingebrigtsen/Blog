On a very short notice - I agreed yesterday (Friday) to do a workshop at Øredev 2010, on Monday. The workshop is called ["Getting Started with Silverlight Development"](http://oredev.org/2010/sessions/getting-started-with-silverlight-development). [Jeff Wilcox](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/) from Microsoft will be doing a parallel track, focusing on Windows Phone 7, my workshop will be focusing on Silverlight on the web and desktop.

Really looking forward to be part of this.
