Want to get a glimpse of what Microsoft Azure is all about and happen to be around Stavanger, Norway at the 15th of December this year.  

I'm holding a introday in Stavanger, Norway focusing on Azure and getting you up to speed with all you need to know to build your own Web application hosted in Azure using the facilities that Azure provides.
