Much to my surprise I learned a couple of days ago that [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) has been nominated for something called the 2010 Niney Awards in the "Favorite Codeplex Project" category, a true honor I must add and thanks for the nomination.

The voting for the entries are community based, so don't be afraid to cast your vote. Working with Balder as much as I've been doing the last 3-4 years now, I won't be sad if you cast your vote in that general direction.. :)
