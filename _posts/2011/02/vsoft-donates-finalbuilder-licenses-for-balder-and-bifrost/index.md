title: "VSoft donates Finalbuilder licenses for Balder and Bifrost"

One of the challenges that has been for [Balder](http://balder.codeplex.com) and the [Bifrost](http://bifrost.codeplex.com) project has been to get a proper build environment up and running. This is something that now is in the works thanks to [VSoft Technologies](http://www.vsofttech.com/) and their [Finalbuilder](http://www.finalbuilder.com). A software I've used with great success over the years.

The plan now is to set up a build server running in [Microsofts Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/azure) and produce nightly builds, but also work as a continuous integration server for the teams working on the projects.

A big thank to VSoft for donating the licenses!
