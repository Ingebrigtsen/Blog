title: "Balder - a developers confession"

For those of you using Balder, you might have seen that 2010 had quite a boost in development for the library, with features being added almost daily, and then all of a sudden it came to a halt.

The last couple of months has been very very busy, its not an excuse - just the hard facts. And the last month or so I really haven't had the energy to do much on Balder.

This however is about to change. I will be focusing a lot more of my energy and time back onto Balder. There are still a few things that need to be done, not to mention some architectural preparations for SL5, when it comes with hardware 3D rendering.

So, please stay tuned. There is more to come. :)
