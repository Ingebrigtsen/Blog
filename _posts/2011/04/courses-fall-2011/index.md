I'll be doing a couple of courses this fall for [Programutvikling](http://www.programutvikling.no), focusing in on LOB development in general with the subject of data access and Azure.

The first course will provide a backdrop for those wanting to take the [MS 70-516 exam](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-516), focusing in on data access in your LOB apps. Read more about it [here](http://www.programutvikling.no/kurskalenderoversikt.aspx?mid_1=1352&mid=1535&id=1072497).

The second course is a crash course in Windows Azure and will provide you with the capability of developing with Azure and take the right choices to make your application scale and become reliable in the cloud, you'll find the details [here](http://www.programutvikling.no/kurskalenderoversikt.aspx?mid_1=1352&mid=1535&id=1072501).
