I've been preparing on and off a talk for [NDC 2011](http://www.ndc2011.no) the last couple of months, at first I was not sure what it would become, but as the agenda came together and it had to get published the subject finally materialized 100%.

The talk will be about CQRS, but not a demo-ware thing - a real life project that uses it. At one of my clients, [Komplett.no](http://www.komplett.no), the largest web-shop in Norway - we have applied CQRS. The talk will be about the experience with how it was applied, how the team learned and what pitfalls we went into.

On [day 3 of NDC 2011](http://ndc2011.no/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&id=-1&day=3728), you'll find me on the 7. track.
