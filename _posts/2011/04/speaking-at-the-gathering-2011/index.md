Easter for some is taking time off to spend with your family, others spend their time at [The Gathering](http://www.gathering.org/tg11/en/), a get together of people with a common interest; computers. This year I've been lucky enough to be asked to speak there. The focus will be Windows Azure and also sneak in some Silverlight and Windows Phone 7 stuff. I'll be there for 2 full days doing multiple talks around these subjects - so if you're at The Gathering and want to learn more about how you can do things in the cloud with your favorite programming environment or want to learn more about doing cool stuff on the Web or the WP7, be sure to look out for the talks on this [page](http://www.gathering.org/tg11/en/creative/seminars/programming/) when they are made available.
