Back in 1997 I started doing some moonlighting on the side - small projects and I needed a company in order to do be able to do the work according to Norwegian law. I started a company called DoLittle Studios, registered dolittle.com as my domain and was set to go. The reasoning behind the name was basically to not do much. :)

Turns out now that the name couldn't be more wrong. As of 1st of March I'm my own boss - working as an independent consultant and as a trainer for [Programutvikling](http://www.programutvikling.no/).
