I've got an interesting question :

When it comes to SharePoint you find a lot of cool articles about how cool the Portal Server is and what not. You also find a lot of articles about programming webparts and changing the layout.  But what I can't find is a simple template site for a blog.  What's up with that?

I've found several guys that actually serves their blog through SharePoint.

It's not that DasBlog is not a cool piece of software; quite the opposite. But, I use SharePoint for everything else and would realllllly love it if I could do blogs with this as well..

BTW: That was my second blog.. :)     By the end of the week, I'll get the hang of this..  Just you wait!
